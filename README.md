# PSP-Chat

## thanks
 this project is possible thanks too of @NT-Bourgeois-Iridescence-Technologies. he thought me the pretty much everything about the psp. you should check his [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSTmaB4YZmnyUSAoerATnsg](youtube channel) out.

## info
 hello visitor, this is a application that let's you talk with other users on your psp. currently this project is in it's early stages. 
 
## buidling & installation
 until the project is usable i won't provide a release. in order to build the project you need the [minimalistic psp sdk](https://sourceforge.net/projects/minpspw/). after you install it go into the psp-chat folder and edit the path on the **!build_psp_chat.bat** also on **!clean_psp_chat.bat** then run **!build_psp_chat.bat**. then you can manually drag and drop the PSP-Chat folder in *PSP-Chat*/output/PSP-Chat to *PSP DRIVE*/PSP/GAME but you can automate this proccess by changing the drive letter in **!upload_psp_chat.bat**.
