# PSP-Chat

## Thanks
 This project is possible thanks to [@NT-Bourgeois-Iridescence-Technologies](https://github.com/NT-Bourgeois-Iridescence-Technologies). He taught me the pretty much everything about PSP programming. You should check his [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSTmaB4YZmnyUSAoerATnsg) out.

## Info
PSP-Chat is an application that lets you talk with other users on your PSP. Currently this project is in it's early stages, but more will be coming soon. 
 
## Building & Installation
Until the project is fully functional, we will not provide a release. In order to build the project you need the [minimalistic psp sdk](https://sourceforge.net/projects/minpspw/). After you install it go into the psp-chat folder and edit the path on the **!build_psp_chat.bat** also on **!clean_psp_chat.bat** then run **!build_psp_chat.bat**. Then you can manually drag and drop the PSP-Chat folder in *PSP-Chat*/output/PSP-Chat to *PSP DRIVE*/PSP/GAME but you can automate this proccess by changing the drive letter in **!upload_psp_chat.bat**.
