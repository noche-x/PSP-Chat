# PSP-Chat

## Thanks
 This project is possible thanks to [@NT-Bourgeois-Iridescence-Technologies](https://github.com/NT-Bourgeois-Iridescence-Technologies). He taught me the pretty much everything about PSP programming. You should check his [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSTmaB4YZmnyUSAoerATnsg) out.

## Info
PSP-Chat is an application that lets you talk with other users on your PSP. Currently this project is in it's early stages, but more will be coming soon. 

## Building & Installation
Until the project is fully functional, we will not provide a release. In order to build the project you need the [minimalistic psp sdk](https://sourceforge.net/projects/minpspw/). After you install it go and right click **My Computer**, select **Properties**, click on **Advanced System Settings**, go into **Advanced tab** and click on **Environment Variables**, on the **System Variables** find **PATH** and Edit it, select **New** and input your **SDK install directory**, click **Ok** and you're done with this part. After all of that go into the psp-chat folder run **build.bat**. Then you can manually drag and drop the **PSP-Chat** folder in *PSP-Chat/output/PSP-Chat* to *PSP DRIVE*/PSP/GAME.
