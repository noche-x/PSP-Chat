## Thanks
 This project is possible thanks to [@NT-Bourgeois-Iridescence-Technologies](https://github.com/NT-Bourgeois-Iridescence-Technologies). He taught me the pretty much everything about PSP programming. You should check his [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSTmaB4YZmnyUSAoerATnsg) out.

## Info
PSP-Chat is an UNOFFICIAL discord client for your PSP. Currently this project is in it's early stages, but more will be coming soon.
NOTE: Currently I'm making a proof of concept video to show this projects potential.
Check out Projects and Issues tab for more info.

## Building & Installation
Until the project is fully functional, we will not provide a release. 

#### Prerequisites 
In order to build the project you need the [**minimalistic psp sdk**](https://sourceforge.net/projects/minpspw/).

After you install it go and right click **My Computer**, select **Properties**, click on **Advanced System Settings**, go into **Advanced tab** and click on **Environment Variables**, on the **System Variables** find **PATH** and Edit it, select **New** and input your **SDK install directory**, click **Ok** and you're done with this part. 

This needs to be done because PSP SDK's path may vary over everone so this makes it local to your computer.

1. Run **build.bat** and it will compile both the server and the psp client.
2. Drag and drop the **PSP-Chat** folder in *PSP-Chat/output/PSP-Chat* to *PSP DRIVE*/PSP/GAME

And you should be able to see it in your PSP.
