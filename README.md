## Thanks
 This project is possible thanks to [@NT-Bourgeois-Iridescence-Technologies](https://github.com/NT-Bourgeois-Iridescence-Technologies). He taught me the pretty much everything about PSP programming. You should check his [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSTmaB4YZmnyUSAoerATnsg) out.

## Recent Updates & News
- [Proof of Concept](https://youtube.com/). I've made a simple POC to show the potential of this project. 

## Info
PSP-Chat is an **UNOFFICIAL** Discord client for your PSP. Currently this project is in it's early stages, but more will be coming soon.

## Building & Installation
Until the project is fully functional, we will not provide a release. 

#### Prerequisites 
In order to build the project you need the [**top-sekret/psptoolchain**](https://github.com/top-sekret/psptoolchain).

After you clone it you can follow the steps provided on that repo.

1. Run **./build.sh** and it will compile the psp client.
~~2. Drag and drop the **PSP-Chat** folder in *PSP-Chat/output/PSP-Chat* to *PSP DRIVE*/PSP/GAME~~
2. Copy **EBOOT.PBP, PARAM.SFO, psp-chat.elf, psp-chat.prx** to /PSP/GAME/PSP-Chat/

And you should be able to see it in your PSP and launch it.
